# National Survey on Drug Use and Health Analysis

## Introduction

This project analyzes the correlations between different kinds of drug abuse, and the possible effects of 
starting age on the types of drugs that are used. The data for this project was collected from a 2012 national
survey about drug use, the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). 

In the second portion of this project, we attempt to use machine learning algorithms (XGBoost and RandomForest) to
classify if someone will partake in hard drug use based on their background factors.
